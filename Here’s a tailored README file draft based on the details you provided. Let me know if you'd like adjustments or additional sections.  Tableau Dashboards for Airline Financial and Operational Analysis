Overview

This project delivers five insightful dashboards built using Tableau, providing a comprehensive analysis of financial and operational data for U.S. airlines. Designed for financial analysts, stakeholders, and operational managers, the dashboards are built from 12 publicly available datasets to highlight trends, efficiency metrics, employee statistics, and financial performance.

Purpose

The dashboards aim to:

Provide actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.
Highlight critical metrics, such as revenue trends, cost efficiency, employee productivity, and airline capacity.
Enhance operational and financial transparency for airlines.

Data Sources

The dashboards are built using Form 41 datasets, publicly available and curated by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Key datasets include:

https://www.transtats.bts.gov/databases.asp?Z1qr_VQ=E&Z1qr_Qr5p=N8vn6v10&f7owrp6_VQF=D

Schedule B-1: Quarterly operating balance sheet for large airlines.
Schedule B-1.1: Semi-annual balance sheet for smaller airlines.
Schedule B-43: Annual inventory of airframes and engines.
Schedule P-1(a): Monthly air carrier employment reports.
Schedule P-1.1: Semi-annual profit and loss for smaller airlines.
Schedule P-1.2: Quarterly profit and loss for larger airlines.
Schedule P-10: Annual employee statistics by labor category.
Schedule P-12(a): Monthly fuel cost and consumption by carrier.
Schedule P-5.1: Aircraft operating expenses for regional carriers.
Schedule P-5.2: Detailed quarterly operating expenses for large airlines.
Schedule P-6: Quarterly operating expenses by objective grouping.
Schedule P-7: Quarterly operating expenses by functional grouping.
T-1: Traffic and capacity summary by service class.
T-2: Traffic and capacity statistics by aircraft type.

Data Cleaning Process

The same cleaning process from the data cleaning script was used for preparing the datasets:

Missing Values: Columns with more than 50% missing values were dropped (excluding protected columns like key metrics).
Duplicates: Duplicate rows were identified and removed.
Outliers: Detected using z-scores and removed.
Data Mapping: Replaced codes and IDs with meaningful labels for better interpretability.
Tableau Features

Key Tableau features used to build the dashboards:

Interactive Filters: Enables users to filter data by airline, time period, or region.
Calculated Fields: Custom calculations for metrics like CASM, PRASM, and PLF.
Drill-down Actions: Allows users to explore data at a more granular level.
Storytelling: Each dashboard is designed with a clear narrative flow, guiding users to key insights.
Responsive Design: Dashboards are optimized for various screen sizes, including desktops and tablets.
