## Welcome

  This project focuses on analyzing the U.S. airline industry using data from the U.S. Department of Transportationâ€™s Form 41, a comprehensive reporting system that requires airlines to report detailed financial and operational information. Additionally, the MIT Airline Data Project (ADP) is used as a secondary data source. Our goal is to create a public-facing web portal that automates the data update process and provides insights into the relationship between stock prices and airline performance metrics using advanced analytical techniques like machine learning.
